• Clusters and Group Forming
Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the falling cluster of Attack Discs to form groups of 3 discs of the same color.
• Combo Groups and Power Meter
You clear the level when your POWER Meter becomes full. You earn more POWER and points by making bigger groups of MORE than 3 discs.

• Multi Groups
You’ll earn more Power and points if you create Groups one turn after another.
• Chain Groups
Earn maximum Power and maximum points by creating more than one Group in the same turn. This is called a ‘chain’.
• Advanced Pattern Blocks (APBs) and Defense Chips
Call upon powerful Sitekick™ Defense Chips by creating patterns of invading aliens. For example, the pattern below will call a Row Defender that will destroy all aliens that are in the same row as the one that it lands in. Place the cluster in the open spot with the blue alien on the bottom to create the APB.
• 2-Player Mode: Transporter Pods
In 2-player mode, when you create big groups of aliens, transporter pods are dropped onto your opponent’s board. Eventually, these turn into aliens and can be destroyed in the usual way. Try to create a group of 4 or more by dropping the red aliens into the open spot.

Player-2 uses the A, S, D, W, and TAB keys to control cluster movement (diagram below).
