1.0 INTRODUCTION
======================

The laboratory of Dr. Frantic harbors a dark secret. Inside its
walls bubbles a vat of Mysterious Alien Ooze. To each little robot
the scientist creates, a drop of Ooze is added to form the electric
Sitekick(TM) core. But today, a massive shadow looms over YAP!
Industries. It’s the shadow of a cold, steely spacecraft filled with
angry aliens bent on taking back what was once theirs. They came for
justice. They came for revenge. They came for the OOZE!!

you need only double-click on the “Sitekick(TM) They Came for the Ooze”
icon on your Desktop. The game will launch; follow the on-screen
instructions.

Alternatively, or if you chose not to create a Desktop shortcut, click
on the Start Menu, choose Programs, then Sitekick(TM) They Came for the
Ooze, then click on the “Sitekick(TM) They Came for the Ooze” icon. The
game will launch; follow the on-screen instructions.


3.2 THE MAIN SCREEN

The main screen is the hub of the game where you start each mission.
There are 6 buttons and 2 checkboxes:

Single Play button	Click to play the game by yourself
Versus Play button	Click to play the game with a friend
Instructions button	Click to read instructions for the game
Hi-Scores button	Click to see the names of all the top
			players who have defended Dr. Frantic’s
			lab from your computer
Credits button		Click to meet the team behind the game
Exit button		Click to quit the game

Customize Sitekick(TM) checkbox
If this box is checked, you’ll be able to configure your Sitekick(TM)
before the game begins

Tutorials checkbox
If this box is checked, the game will begin
with a quick tutorial that explains the basics of how to play


======================
4.0 CUSTOMIZE SITEKICK(TM) SCREEN
======================

If the ‘Customize Sitekick(TM)’ box is checked when you start the game,
you’ll be brought to the Customize Sitekick(TM) screen before gameplay
begins. This screen lets you configure your Sitekick(TM) with different
chips that change various aspects of the game. The screen contains 2
Sitekick(TM) Docks, one for Player 1 and one for Player 2. If you’re
playing in Single Player mode, the Player 2 dock is disabled. If a
second player wants to join in at this stage, just click on player 2
dock where it says “Press Here to Add a Second Player”.

Note: If the ‘Customize Sitekick(TM)’ box is NOT checked when you start
the game, it will run with the last configuration that was used, or a
default configuration if it’s the first time the game has been played.


4.1 STRENGTH CHIP

Choose a Strength Chip to define what type of move your Sitekick(TM)
will excel at. The three types of basic moves that you can perform are
Combo Groups, Multi Groups, and Chains (these are explained in more
detail in the Tutorial section). Each of these provides extra points
and power. If your Sitekick(TM)’s Strength Chip is weighted towards
Combos, you’ll earn more points and power for a Combo Group than a
player whose Sitekick(TM) uses a different type of Strength Chip.
Available Strength Chips are:

Combo Chip	Most skilled at Combo Groups; least skilled at Chains
Multi Chip	Most skilled at Multi Groups; least skilled at
		Combo Groups
Chain Chip	Most skilled at Chains; least skilled at Multi Groups


4.2 BATTERY CHIP

Choose a Battery Chip to define how quickly you accumulate and use up
power. When you create Combo Groups, Multi Groups and Chains, you earn
power, which is added to your Power Meter beneath the game board. This
power decays if you don’t continue making these groups. The Battery
Chips affect power accumulation and use. The following Battery Chips
are available:

Guzzler Chip	Accumulates power quickly, but uses it up quickly too
Neutral Chip	Accumulates and uses power at a normal rate
Economy Chip	Accumulates power slowly, but uses it up slowly too


4.3 MOVEMENT CHIP
Choose a Movement Chip to define how your Rotation Key works. In
Single Player Mode, the Up arrow is your Rotation Key and rotates the
falling clusters of alien invaders on the game board. The following
Movement Chips are available:

Right Chip	Rotates clusters clockwise
Lateral Chip	Cycles the position of alien invaders within the cluster
Left Chip	Rotates clusters counter-clockwise


4.4 SHAPE CHIP

Choose a Shape Chip to define the shape of incoming clusters of alien
invaders. The following Shape Chips are available:

Static Row Chip	Clusters appear in rows of 3
Variable Chip	Clusters take on various shapes

The screen at the top of each dock displays the name of the chips that
you have chosen and the effect that it will have.


4.5 EXPERIENCE LEVEL

Each player can choose an Experience Level. This allows you to start at
a higher level to either make a single player game more challenging, or
to make a 2 player game fairer.

When you have configured your Sitekick(TM) the way you want it, click
the Play button at the bottom of the screen to begin the game. To go
back to the Main Screen, click the MAIN button at the bottom of the screen.


======================
5.0 HI-SCORES SCREEN
======================

Visit the Hi-Scores screen to see the Top 10 Defenders from both Single
Player and Versus Modes. These are the players to beat!

There are two 1-Player Hi-Score lists. The first shows the high scores
played on your computer, the second shows the top scores from ALL
Defenders all over the world (Galactic Hi-Scores).

At the end of a game, if your score is high enough, you’ll be asked if
you want to submit it to the Hi-Score list.


======================
6.0 TUTORIAL
======================

If the ‘Tutorial’ box is checked when you start the game, you’ll be
brought to a Tutorial before gameplay begins. This tutorial will step
you through the basics of the game to get you up to speed quickly. Use
the NEXT button to continue to the next step of the Tutorial, the SKIP
button to skip to the next skill, or the SKIP ALL button to begin
playing. The following skills are covered:


6.1 CLUSTERS AND GROUP FORMING

Use the arrow keys and the SPACEBAR on the keyboard to move the falling
cluster of invaders to form groups of 3 that are the same colour. The
left and right arrows move the clusters side to side, the up arrow
rotates the cluster, the down arrow speeds it up and the SPACEBAR drops
it immediately. Create a group of red or blue aliens.


6.2 COMBO GROUPS AND POWER METER

You clear a level when your Power Meter is filled. You earn more Power
(and Points too) by making bigger groups (groups of more than 3). Create
a Combo group of 4 or more blue aliens.


6.3 MULTI GROUPS

You’ll earn even more Power and Points by creating groups one turn after
another. These are called Multi Groups. Create a group of blue aliens and
then a group of red ones…a Multi Group!


6.4 CHAINS

Earn maximum Power and Points by creating more than one group in the same
turn. This is called a Chain. Drop the cluster of alien invaders into one
of the openings with the blue ones on the bottom. That will remove a group
of blue aliens and then a red group will be created…a Chain!


6.5 ADVANCED PATTERN BLOCKS (APBs)

Call upon powerful Sitekick(TM) Defense Chips by creating patterns of
invading aliens. For example, the pattern below will call a Row Defender
that will destroy all aliens that are in the same row as the one that it
lands in. Place the cluster in the open spot with the blue alien on the
bottom to create the APB.


6.6 2-PLAYER MODE: CONTROLS AND TRANSPORTER

In 2 Player Mode, when you create big groups of aliens, transporter pods
are dropped you’re your opponent’s board. Eventually, these turn into aliens
and can be destroyed in the usual way. Try to create a group of 4 or more by
dropping the red aliens into the open spot. Player 2 uses the A, D, W, S, and
TAB keys to control clusters left side of the screen. The A and D keys move
the clusters side to side, the W key rotates the cluster, the S key speeds
it up and the TAB key drops it immediately. Player 1 uses the arrow keys
and the SPACEBAR to control clusters on the board on the right side of
the screen.

======================
7.0 GAMEPLAY SPECIFIC TO SINGLE PLAYER MODE
======================

7.1 OBJECTIVE

Fill the power meter at the bottom of the game board to progress to the
next level. The goal is to repel the alien invaders as long as possible
and collect as many points as you can. When you complete a level, any
empty spots on the board earn you 10 bonus points.


7.2 BONUS ROUNDS

After every 3rd round, you have the chance to attack a Bonus Round. This
is an opportunity to earn BIG point bonuses. To win the Bonus Round, clear
the board completely of all invaders before the timer runs out.

For clearing the bonus round, you’ll also earn a Sitekick(TM) Chip that
you can load into your online Sitekick(TM) Chip Dock if you're a member of
YTV.com. When you’re awarded a Sitekick(TM) Chip, enter your YTV.com
username, and click the NEXT button. You’ll get a code in return. Hit the
COPY button and then click on the link to http://www.ytv.com/sitekick/dock.asp.
On YTV.com, click in the Secret Code box at the side of the screen, hold
down the CTRL button and press the "v" key to paste the code into the code
box. Hit ENTER and the chip will be placed in your Sitekick Dock. You can
only use this code once and it won't work if you share it with other users.


======================
8.0 GAMEPLAY SPECIFIC TO VERSUS MODE
======================

8.1 OBJECTIVE

Outlast your opponent by keeping alien invaders from reaching the top of
your game board and transferring invaders to your opponent’s board using
Transporter Pods. You must beat your opponent 3 times to win. The dots at
the bottom of the game boards keep track of how many rounds you’ve won.


8.2 BONUS PODS

Every time you fill your Power Meter in Versus Mode, you earn a Bonus Pod.
Then, whenever you deposit Transporter Pods on your opponent’s board, an
extra Pod is added for every Bonus Pod you’ve earned.


======================
9.0 GAMEPLAY EXTRAS (SINGLE & VERSUS MODE)
======================

9.1 GAMEPLAY MECHANICS

See the Tutorial section above for general gameplay mechanics for both
Single Player and Versus Modes.


9.2 SITEKICK(TM) DEFENSE CHIPS

Sitekick(TM) Defense Chips are special chips that fall as part of a
cluster. These chips destroy large groups of aliens when they land. You
call on Sitekick(TM) Defense Chips by creating Advance Pattern Blocks
(APBs), pre-defined patterns of different coloured invaders. Here is a
list of Sitekick(TM) Defense Chips and the Advance Pattern Blocks that
call them out:
	

  9.2.1 COLUMN DEFENDER
  Eliminates all invaders in the column that the Chip lands in
  APB:	x
	x	
	y	
	y


  9.2.2 colour DEFENDER
  Eliminates all the invaders that are the same colour as the one that
  the Chip lands on
  APB:	xxyy
	yyxx
 

  9.2.3 ROW DEFENDER
  Eliminates all invaders in the row that the Chip lands in	 
  APB: xxyyy -OR- xxxyy


*Note: APBs can be made of any two colours of invaders.

Additional Defense Chips will be made available from time to time on YTV.com
(some will be rarer than others). Once you’ve downloaded these new chips,
they’ll load automatically the next time you launch the game and will be
available to use in gameplay.


9.3 INTENSITY CHIPS

If you create 3 Multi Groups or Chains in a row, an Intensity Chip will fall
on the game board at the location where the last Multi or Chain was created.
You can collect this chip by including it in a group of any colour. You
can collect up to 6 intensity chips which will be docked at the top of your
game board. Intensity Chips determine the number of Sitekick(TM) Defense
Chips that are released when you create an Advanced Pattern Block (APB).

0-2 Intensity Chips collected
	=> 1 Sitekick(TM) Defense Chip released from an APB

3-5 Intensity Chips collected
	=> 2 Sitekick(TM) Defense Chips released from an APB

6 Intensity Chips collected
	=> 3 Sitekick(TM) Defense Chips released from an APB


9.4 CLEAR THE BOARD FOR BONUS POINTS

Every time you clear the board completely of all alien invaders, you earn
a 500 point bonus.
